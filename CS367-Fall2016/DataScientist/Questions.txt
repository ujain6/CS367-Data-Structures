Directions: answer the following six (6) questions. 

1) Before running your program, what is the worst complexity of building tree for 
ArrayList, Binary Search Tree, Binary Search Tree with a small positive
rebalance factor(e.g 2) and RBTree?

Answer:

2) Before running your program, what is the worst complexity of contains search for 
ArrayList, Binary Search Tree, Binary Search Tree with a small positive
rebalance factor(e.g 2) and RBTree?

Answer:

3) Before running your program, what is the worst complexity of range search for 
ArrayList, Binary Search Tree, Binary Search Tree with a small positive
rebalance factor(e.g 2) and RBTree? Assume the range is small.

Answer:

For questions 4 - 6, you should use the Evaluator program as written.

4) In this question you will run the program using the parameters 
indicated below:

random_1000.txt 10 2 3

a)For random data, what are the rankings (from fastest to slowest) for the four 
data structures based on the mean time of building a tree, contains search, and range
search? 
b)What about for the sorted data?

Answer:

5) In this question you will run the program using the parameters 
indicated below:

random_10000.txt 10 2 3

a)Does the ranking change for the larger data set on random data and sorted data? 
b)Which data structure has the largest growth rate function? Explain your answers in terms
of building tree, contains search and range search for random data and sorted data.

Answer:

6) In this question you will run the program using the parameters 
indicated below:

random_1000.txt 10 2 3
random_1000.txt 10 5 3
random_1000.txt 10 10 3

Briefly explain how the rebalanceThreshold effects the time for building tree, contains search 
and range search.

Answer:
